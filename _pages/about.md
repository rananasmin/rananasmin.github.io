## About Me
My journey into cybersecurity started with a simple curiosity: Why do systems behave the way they do and how do they break? What began as exploring logs and tinkering with small setups grew into building full environments with Active Directory, then Wazuh, Suricata, ELK, and OPNsense. I found myself drawn to patterns failed authentications, strange network flows, indicators hidden in plain sight and the thrill of uncovering how attackers move through systems. From analyzing brute-force attempts to writing my own detection rules and automating workflows with Shuffle SOAR, every experiment taught me a new layer of how modern attacks unfold and how defenders can stay one step ahead.

But the deeper I went, the more I realized cybersecurity is bigger than just detection. I started breaking web apps, reversing Android APKs, studying cloud security misconfigurations, and experimenting with exploits on vulnerable machines. Each project felt like a puzzle, understand the system, study its weaknesses, replicate the adversary’s mindset, and then build something stronger than before. Over time, this curiosity turned into a passion not just for defense or offense, but for the process of researching, experimenting, and learning how different pieces of technology interconnect. Today, I’m driven by the same question that started it all What’s really happening beneath the surface and how can I make it better?
